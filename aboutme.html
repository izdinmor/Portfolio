                    My name is Guillaume Tempels and im 21 years old
                    I am currently in third year in the "Ludus acad√©mie", a school
                    where we are being taught all there is to know about game design, game development and a bit of web development.
                    I am cool headed, not self-centered and love learning new things

                <h1>What i like ?</h1>
                <p>
                    Beside my studies i am a scout leader in a small scout unit (i have been there since i was 5 years old) and play table tennis at a moderate level !
                    I like playing video games, i mostly play at League of legends for the multiplayer game, for the single player games i prefer rogue-like,platform,rpg and puzzle games.
                    I also like reading mostly dark fantasy and a bit of science-fiction.
